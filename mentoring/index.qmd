Rut worked with me since day one. She was the first student I had the opportunity to mentor, so we were both learning together. Hard worker and enthusiastic, she got to present at a national conference and she is a co-author in all the butterfly physiology work. Rut just graduated from CWRU in 2024 and is now starting a Master's program.

He was able to adapt plant software to conduct butterfly wing analysis. He will be a senior at CWRU this year and is interested in starting graduate school in amphibian ecology research.
