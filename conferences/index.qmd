# ESA 2024

At the Ecological Society of America meeting 2024 in Long Beach, California I had the opportunity to be an organizer and speaker at the Special Session *Towards equity in the communication of science: harnessing the power of AI for an inclusive tomorrow*. 
I presented my work (titled: ¿Qué herramientas ayudan ante el cambio? Physiological tolerances as a tool to assess butterfly vulnerability to climate change) in my native language (Spanish) while using AI interpretation.
