# Welcome to my website!

My name is Osmary Medina-BÃ¡ez. I earned my B. Sc. in Biology from the University of Puerto Rico in 2017, a M. Sc. in Biology from John Caroll University in 2020, and I am currently a PhD Candidate in the Biology Department at Case Western Reserve University. Over the years I have worked in different countries, different topics, and different study systems, always related to my main interest; species and habitat conservation. On this website, you will see a glimpse of my past and ongoing research, publications, as well as diversity and inclusion work I am very passionate about.

My research interests span Ecology, Ecophysiology, Herpetology and Entomology. I am particularly passionate about species response to climate change, and I have made significant contributions to the understanding of these subjects. Some of the projects I have been involved with include tracking and monitoring of endangered species, population assessments, as well as research projects to determine the mechanisms driving population changes. Some of the study systems I have worked with include tropical and temperate salamanders, snakes, lizards, geckos and sea turtles. More recently I have been introduced to the insect world and have been focusing on learning as much as I can about pollinators during my PhD, specifically Northamerican butterflies.

I am also very interested in teaching and mentoring. I have worked at a teaching assistant during my graduate studies in general biology introductory laboratory courses, where I have had the opportunity to engage with students just being introduced to a research environment and have really enjoyed trying to get students to discover their own interests in science. I have also worked as a teaching assistant for more advanced courses, like geographic information systems (GIS) analysis. 

I have had the opportunity to mentor several amazing students at CWRU. I have enjoyed teaching them what I know about science and research, even a bit about a life, and how things don't always go as you expect. Most importantly, I have learned a lot from my students. Their energy and interest in learning new things reminds me why I decided to follow this path. I will be forever thankful to them.

On this website, I will be regularly updating my latest work, published articles and attended conferences.
